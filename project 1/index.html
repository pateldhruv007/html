    <p>This tiger inhabits the Indian subcontinent.[19] Linnaeus's scientific description of the tiger was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi.[2] Bengal tiger skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London were described as bright orange-red with shorter fur and more spaced out stripes than northern-living tigers like the Siberian tiger.</p>
    <p>This population lived in west-central Asia, reach as far west as Turkey.[19] Illiger's description was not based on a particular specimen, but he only assumed that tigers in the Caspian area differ from those elsewhere.[20] It was later described having a bright rusty-red coat with thin and closely spaced brownish stripes,[21] and a broad occipital bone.[11] According to genetic analysis, it was closely related to the Siberian tiger.</p>
    <p>The tiger is found on the Indochinese Peninsula.[19] Maz√°k's description was based on 25 specimens in museum collections that were smaller than tigers from India and had smaller skulls.[28] It was also said to have a darker coat than the Bengal tiger with more stripes; the stripes being narrower and having less "double stripes".</p>
